## About CDE2503 - Cities in Nature
This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the "Sustainable Environment" outcome of the Singapore Liveability Framework (LF) that was developed by the Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC). It will address what is sustainability, and how it affects liveability. Most importantly, you will be able to understand how cities address complex issues.

This module will cover the themes of Blue and Green in Nature, and Climate Resilient District, covering topics such as water, green, waste, food, climate mitigation, climate adaptation, and energy resilience. Using case studies, students will glean insights on how to balance different stakeholders while solving complex urban issues. 

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand key principles taught within the themes of Blue and Green in Nature, and Climate Resilient District that shapes the development of a blue, green and climate resilient city
- Examine and evaluate how blue, green or biophilic the city is with reference to the plans implemented by agencies in Singapore 
- Identify problem(s) that prevents a city from achieving the Sustainable Environment outcome of the LF
- Formulate solution(s) using key principles highlighted in the two broad themes of Blue and Green in Nature and Climate Resilient District to address problem(s) identified 
- Analyse and evaluate solution(s) with the use of simulation and prediction models to highlight benefits and trade-offs 
- Propose biophilic solution(s) in the form of policies, plans and programmes

### Lectures
- We will have 7 lectures in total. One lecture per week. 
- These lectures will be split into two themes. The first three will focus on data analysis, 
  which will be followed by another three lectures on data visualization.  
- Lectures will be held live on Zoom and will be recorded. 
  I will also provide additional face-to-face support if you prefer to come to the classroom to attend the lectures. 

### Studio
- We will have 5 studios in total. They are either working studio where you get to have discussion session with your team, SL and TA, or presentation studio where you present your findings.
- Studios will happen on weeks where there is no lecture.
- Information about the studios can be found on [Canvas](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals) or on [Github](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/)
- Feel free to write to your SL and TA if you have any questions. 

### Office Hours
- Weekly fixed office hours can be found on the [Schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link schedule.md %}) tab, 
  and will be held either virtually or in-person depending on your needs.
- I have an open-door policy. So feel free to drop by my office for any reason, including course material clarification, 
  questions on tutorials, assignments, and projects, or even just to hang out.
