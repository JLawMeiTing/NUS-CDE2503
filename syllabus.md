## About CDE2503 - Cities in Nature
This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the "Sustainable Environment" outcome of the Singapore Liveability Framework (LF) that was developed by the Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC). It will address what is sustainability, and how it affects liveability. Most importantly, you will be able to understand how cities address complex issues. 

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand key principles taught within the themes of Blue and Green in Nature, and Climate Resilient District that shapes the development of a blue, green and climate resilient city
- Examine and evaluate how blue, green or biophilic the city is with reference to the plans implemented by agencies in Singapore 
- Identify problem(s) that prevents a city from achieving the Sustainable Environment outcome of the LF
- Formulate solution(s) using key principles highlighted in the two broad themes of Blue and Green in Nature and Climate Resilient District to address problem(s) identified 
- Analyse and evaluate solution(s) with the use of simulation and prediction models to highlight benefits and trade-offs 
- Propose biophilic solution(s) in the form of policies, plans and programmes

### Lectures
- We will have 6 lectures in total. One lecture per week. 
- These lectures will be split into two themes. The first three will focus on data analysis, 
  which will be followed by another three lectures on data visualization.  
- Lectures will be held live on Zoom and will be recorded. 
  I will also provide additional face-to-face support if you prefer to come to the classroom to attend the lectures. 

### Tutorials
- We will have 6 tutorials in total. One tutorial per week. 
- Tutorials are prepared in Jupyter Notebook format and are fully available [online](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals). 
- We understand that sometimes programming and debugging could be cumbersome. So please come to the computer lab to do tutorials so that the TAs
  and I can provide hands-on help.
- You are welcome to seek help during office hours or through emails. But the best place to get help is the weekly tutorial session.  

### Office Hours
- Weekly fixed office hours can be found on the [Schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link schedule.md %}) tab, 
  and will be held either virtually or in-person depending on your needs.
- I have an open-door policy. So feel free to drop by my office for any reason, including course material clarification, 
  questions on tutorials, assignments, and projects, or even just to hang out.  

## Textbooks and Materials

- Primary textbook: [**pyCIVIL**](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals) (**py**thon **C**l**I**mate **VI**sua**L**s), 
  a free online textbook that is currently under development.
  Your comments and suggestions are welcome. 
- Supplementary textbook: [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). (free online book; although based on `R`, 
  it is a great guide to make fabulous visualizations that correctly reflect the data). 
- A computer.
- Stable internet connection. 

## Grading Scheme

| Assignment type          | Weight   | Number      |
|:-------------------------|:---------|:------------|
